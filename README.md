# Google Capstone (Track 2)

Welcome to my second case study with R! I've recently just started learning R as part of the Coursera: Google Data Analytics Certification Course. 
I have published two notebooks as part of the capstone projects assigned to us in the course. Even though these notebooks are published, I aim to come 
back to these case studies to further improve my analysis as I learn more about data analytics and statistics! 

With that being said, I will be doing several exploratory data analysis (EDA) on data sets of my interests with Python! Stay tuned! :)
